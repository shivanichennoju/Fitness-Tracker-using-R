Welcome to our application!

Please note that in order to create or delete records for tables "steps" and "minutes," you must first perform these operations on the "daily calories" table, as it is the parent table referencing those child tables.

During registration, please ensure that your username and password are composed of numbers only. The system does not accept characters in these fields.

If you are a new user, please note that you will not be able to access any insights until you have added at least one row to each table starting with "daily calories."

For existing users, such as "1503960366" and "1624580081," you can view insights by logging in with username (with those user ID's) and password (which is "1234").

As for admin credentials, the user ID is "12345" and the password is "12345."

Thank you for using our application!
